# challenge-3

## Description

The challenge for this assignment was to write a program that will generate a random password based on the criteria a user provides. This challenge features dynamically updated HTML and CSS that is powered by Javascript.

In this project I learned how to practice:
- Identifying and Declaring Variables and Functions: to make HTML and CSS dynamic and store values for logic.
- Conditional statements: To add logic to code.
- Iteration: to iterate over an array with a for loop.
